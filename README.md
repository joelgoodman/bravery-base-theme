Bravery Base Template
===

This theme is based on `_s` [from Automattic](http://underscores.me) and the `_s_backbone` modifications [by tlovett1](https://github.com/tlovett1/_s_backbone) to incorporate WordPress's Backbone.js infrastructure for dynamic content loading. To use the Backbone functionality, the site will require the [WP-API plugin](http://wp-api.com) until it is finally incorporated into WordPress core.

This theme is meant as a base starting-point for future WordPress themes. Direct from the `Underscores` README:

* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* A helpful 404 template.
* A sample custom header implementation in `inc/custom-header.php` that can be activated by uncommenting one line in `functions.php` and adding the code snippet found in the comments of `inc/custom-header.php` to your `header.php` template.
* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Some small tweaks in `inc/extras.php` that can improve your theming experience.
* A script at `js/navigation.js` that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It's enqueued in `functions.php`.
* Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
* Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.
