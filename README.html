<h1>Bravery Base Template</h1>

<p>This theme is based on <code>_s</code> <a href="http://underscores.me">from Automattic</a> and the <code>_s_backbone</code> modifications <a href="https://github.com/tlovett1/_s_backbone">by tlovett1</a> to incorporate WordPress&rsquo;s Backbone.js infrastructure for dynamic content loading. To use the Backbone functionality, the site will require the <a href="http://wp-api.com">WP-API plugin</a> until it is finally incorporated into WordPress core.</p>

<p>This theme is meant as a base starting-point for future WordPress themes. Direct from the <code>Underscores</code> README:</p>

<ul>
<li>A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.</li>
<li>A helpful 404 template.</li>
<li>A sample custom header implementation in <code>inc/custom-header.php</code> that can be activated by uncommenting one line in <code>functions.php</code> and adding the code snippet found in the comments of <code>inc/custom-header.php</code> to your <code>header.php</code> template.</li>
<li>Custom template tags in <code>inc/template-tags.php</code> that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.</li>
<li>Some small tweaks in <code>inc/extras.php</code> that can improve your theming experience.</li>
<li>A script at <code>js/navigation.js</code> that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It&rsquo;s enqueued in <code>functions.php</code>.</li>
<li>Smartly organized starter CSS in <code>style.css</code> that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.</li>
<li>Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.</li>
</ul>
